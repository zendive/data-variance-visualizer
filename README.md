# data-variance-visualizer
Binary data variance visualizer by prepending BMP image header to a target file, so it can be reviewed for patterns, gaps, fragmentation etc. Used for checking data dispersion while developing custom cipher algorithm (for learning purposes).

That technick also may be used to draw preview image of streamed data w/o taking in account its meaning or format.
For example: screen saver sniffing for HDD/Network I/O activity, mobile/web application infographics.
